/**
 * Filtering the Inspector timeline (#1625).
 *
 * Pure predicates over the projected trace, deliberately not a query API on the
 * contract: the questions a reader brings to a trace are `Array.filter` over
 * `TraceStep[]`, and inventing a query language for them would be surface
 * nobody needs.
 *
 * Two predicates, because they are the two the panel can produce. Kind and cost
 * filters are easy to write here and were, but a predicate no control emits is
 * dead surface with tests that guard nothing; they come back when the controls
 * that drive them are designed.
 *
 * Free text matches what each row renders, in the language it renders in: the
 * localized name, qualifier and recovery of a step, and the turn's own display
 * name. It takes the copy for that reason — the trace's raw identifiers
 * (`semantic_compact`, `allow`, `turn-7`) are not on screen, so matching them
 * would answer a reader who typed what they saw with silence.
 *
 * It deliberately does **not** reach into event bodies: that is
 * `searchRuntimeEventHistory`'s job, and shipping every tool result into the
 * renderer to imitate it would multiply a payload this panel is already asked
 * to bound, with silent truncation as the only way out. A filter that quietly
 * stops matching is worse than one with a stated reach.
