/**
 * Shared main-session prompt assembly (#2352).
 *
 * Main-session system prompts used to be built only from functional fragments
 * (personalization, skills, AGENTS.md, memory, …) and never opened with a
 * product identity. This closes that gap while leaving sub-agent identities to
 * the agent catalog.
 *
 * The assembler is deliberately order-agnostic: it only prepends the identity,
 * drops empty fragments, and joins. It does NOT impose a fixed fragment order,
 * because several fragments are position-semantic and must stay where the host
 * put them — e.g. the Side Chat isolation boundary and the Deep Research mode
 * contract are trailing assertions that constrain everything before them, so
 * moving them earlier weakens them. Each host keeps its existing fragment order.
 *
 * The identity line is pure static text: constant across turns, so it never
 * churns the systemPromptHash / prefix-cache (see request-shape.ts). It is
 * intentionally NOT injected into sub-agent (childInstruction) paths, which
 * already carry their own role identities.
